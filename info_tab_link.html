                    <p id = text_1>Dementia presents a significant challenge for patients, providers, health systems in the U.S. The disease is 50% more costly than heart disease or cancer. A patient with dementia costs 3x more than one without. And with 5.8 million Americans already diagnosed and 50 million more at risk, caring for these patients will put tremendous pressure on the nation’s 250,000 primary care physicians and 15,000 neurologists.</p>

                <div class = "text_2">
                    <p>BrainCheck conducted a pilot study with Hartford Healthcare to measure the platform’s ability to improve care and reduce costs. Four providers (representing primary care, geriatrics and neurology), administered 60 cognitive assessments using the platform, demonstrating:</p>

                            With an even split between in-clinic and remote cognitive assessments, BrainCheck received an average system usability score of 85 from providers, which is considerably higher than the industry average of 68 and puts the platform in the 95th percentile for software products. And 80% of patients said they were satisfied with their experience despite the fact that many were diagnosed with dementia.

                            BrainCheck increased the specificity of diagnosis from 28% specific prior to using Braincheck to 68% specific with BrainCheck. BrainCheck gives physicians the ability to distinguish dementia from other treatable conditions and offer reassurance to those with subjective memory loss.

                            After BrainCheck, two thirds of patients received a plan of care. For patients who did not receive a cognitive care plan, most had a rationale (subjective memory loss, “not dementia,” “no cognitive impairment,” anxiety). Only three patients failed to receive a plan of care without a reason.
